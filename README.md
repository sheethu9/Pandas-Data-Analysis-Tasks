Pandas Data Analysis - Sales Data
Project Overview
In this project, I use Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries to analyze and answer business-related questions based on a year's worth of sales data. The dataset contains hundreds of thousands of transactions from an electronics store, providing details on various aspects such as the month of purchase, product categories, costs, purchase locations, and more. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from this data to support data-driven business decisions.

Steps in the Project
1. Data Cleaning
The first step in the analysis process involves cleaning the dataset. This includes:

Dropping rows with missing or NaN values.

Removing rows based on specific conditions.

Changing column data types (e.g., converting strings to numeric values, parsing dates, etc.).

2. Data Exploration
   After cleaning the data, the next phase involves answering several key business questions. These questions aim to uncover trends and insights that can guide business strategies. The questions explored include:

What was the best month for sales, and how much revenue was earned during that month?

Which city generated the most sales?

What is the best time to display advertisements to maximize customer purchases?

Which products are most often sold together?

Which product sold the most, and what might explain its success?

3. Methods and Techniques Used During the project,
I used several Pandas and Matplotlib techniques to manipulate and visualize the data:

Concatenating multiple CSV files: Merging data from different sources using pd.concat.

Adding new columns: Using basic operations to add meaningful information to the DataFrame.

String parsing: Using the .str accessor to manipulate string data in the dataset.

Applying functions: Using the .apply() method for row-wise or column-wise operations.

Groupby and aggregation: Leveraging groupby to perform aggregate analysis for insights.

Visualization: Plotting bar charts and line graphs with Matplotlib to visualize trends and findings.

Graph labeling: Adding appropriate labels to charts for better clarity.
